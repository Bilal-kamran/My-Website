        <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
        <article>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>C</b>
              <p>I have three years of experience in C programming. My expertise 
                includes memory allocation, file I/O operations, and 
                working with pointers. I am proficient in using header files to 
                organize code and have developed many complex algorithms. 
                This solid foundation in C has equipped me with essential skills 
                for efficient and effective software development.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>x86-64 Assembly</b>
              <p>I've dabbled in x86-64 Assembly, gaining insight into how 
                computers execute instructions at a very low level. This 
                experience has improved my understanding of CPU architecture
                , registers, and memory addressing.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Bash</b>
              <p>I am proficient in Bash scripting, which allows me to automate tasks and manage 
                system operations efficiently. I’ve written numerous scripts to handle 
                file management, process automation, and other system administration tasks.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Lua</b>
              <p>I've learned Lua, a lightweight scripting language, 
                which I use primarily for configuring and extending 
                applications like Neovim. Lua’s simplicity and 
                flexibility make it a great tool for rapid 
                development and prototyping.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Git</b>
              <p>I am well-versed in Git, the distributed version control 
                system, which I use to manage my code, track changes, 
                and collaborate with other developers. I understand its basics very well.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Frontend</b>
              <p>I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to 
                create responsive and dynamic web interfaces. These 
                technologies form the foundation of frontend development 
                and enable me to build visually appealing and interactive 
                websites.</p>

        <h3>Graphic Design Experience</h3>
        <p>I possess a diverse set of graphic designing skills
          , honed through extensive experience with various industry-
          standard tools and software. I am proficient in using Blender 
          for 3D modeling and animation, which allows me to create stunning 
          visuals and realistic renderings. My expertise extends to Adobe 
          tools such as Photoshop for image editing, Illustrator 
          for vector graphics, and XD for UI/UX design, enabling me to craft 
          professional and engaging designs. Additionally, I have hands-on 
          experience with open-source software like Krita for digital painting, 
          GIMP for photo manipulation, and Inkscape for vector illustrations. 
          These tools collectively empower me to produce high-quality and 
          versatile graphic designs for a wide range of projects.</p>
