                    <h2>About Me</h2>

                    <p>Hello! My name is Bilal Kamran. I am an aspiring talent in the field of computer science. With three
                        years of experience in C programming, I have developed a solid foundation in system-level
                        programming
                        and algorithms. My journey in programming has been complemented by my explorations in assembly
                        language,
                        Bash scripting, and graphic design using tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Blender. My
                        curiosity and passion for learning drive me to continuously improve and expand my skill set.</p>

                    <h2>My Interests</h2>

                    <p>I have a diverse range of interests that include programming, digital arts, electrical engineering,
                        space, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and astronomy (the actual study of space). I am particularly
                        fascinated by the interplay between these fields and how they contribute to our understanding of the
                        world and the universe.</p>

                    <h2>My Goals</h2>

                    <p>My primary goal is to become a professional in the fields of programming and digital arts. I aspire
                        to
                        master C programming and other languages to develop robust and innovative software solutions.
                        Simultaneously, I aim to enhance my skills in graphic design and 3D modeling to create impactful and
                        visually appealing works. I am committed to continuous learning and practical experience, always
                        seeking
                        new challenges to grow my expertise and contribute meaningfully to my chosen fields.</p>

                <h2>My Projects</h2>

                <p>Throughout my programming journey, I've focused on developing projects in C, honing my skills in system-level programming and algorithms. I am continuously working on various projects that are still in progress. Below are some highlights.</p>

                    <h3>Guess The Number (C)</h3>

                    <p>This project involved creating a simple game where the player has to guess a randomly generated
                        number. I faced challenges in handling user input and implementing the game logic, which provided
                        valuable learning experiences in programming.</p>

                    <h3>Calculator Project (C)</h3>

                    <p>I am currently working on a comprehensive Calculator project that includes developing complex
                        algorithms to handle various user inputs. Additionally, I am working on implementing data structures
                        and algorithms (DSA) and designing a graphical user interface (GUI) using GTK 4.0 or later. This
                        project has been challenging and rewarding, as it pushes me to enhance my problem-solving and
                        programming skills.</p>
