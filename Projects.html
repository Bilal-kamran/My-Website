        <h2>My Projects</h2>

        <!-- talk about the things you have worked on and then what you want to work on -->
        <p>Throughout my programming journey, I have delved into a variety of projects that span the spectrum from
          basic logic building to developing complex algorithms, and creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). My
          work includes handling user input, error management, file operations, and memory management in C,
          showcasing my comprehensive understanding and application of these critical aspects of programming.
          Currently, I am focused on building this portfolio to display my skills and achievements effectively. In
          addition, I am actively working on configuring Neovim using Lua, enhancing my development environment
          and contributing to my continuous learning and growth in the field.

          I am also proficient in using Bash scripting to manage tasks such as creating backups and automating
          routine processes, which has significantly improved my productivity. Moreover, I am continuously
          learning new aspects of assembly language, with plans to undertake a basic project in assembly soon,
          further broadening my programming expertise.</p>

          <h3>Guess The Number (C)</h3>

          <b>Overview:</b>

          <p>The "Guess The Number" game is a simple project where the player guesses a randomly generated number
            within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or
            correct.</p>

          <b>Key Features:</b>

          <ul>

            <li>

              <b>Random Number Genenration:</b>

              <p>Uses rand() to generate a number between 1 and 100.</p>

            </li>

            <li>

              <b>User Input Handling:</b>

              <p>Prompts the player to enter guesses and validates inputs. It also handles invalid input
                easily.</p>

            </li>

            <li>

              <b>Game Logic:</b>

              <p>Implements a loop to allow multiple attempts and uses conditionals to provide feedback.</p>

            </li>

            <li>

              <b>Score and Replay System:</b>

              <p>Tracks the player's score and allows the game to be replayed with a fresh number.</p>

            </li>

            <li>

              <b>Winning Condition:</b>

              <p>Once the correct guess is made, the loop exits, and the game displays a message indicating
                the number of attempts made.</p>

            </li>

          </ul>

          <b>Learning Outcomes:</b>

          <p>This project enhances your understanding of random number generation, user input handling, and
            control structures in C, providing a solid foundation for more advanced programming challenges.</p>

          <h3>Calculator Project (C)</h3>

          <p>In this project, 
            I am developing a comprehensive calculator application in C, 
            focusing on integrating advanced programming concepts and 
            complex algorithms.</p>

          <ul>

            <b>Key Learning Points</b>

            <li>

              <b>Header Files</b>

              <p>I have organized my code using header files (.h). 
                This helps in separating declarations from implementations, 
                improving modularity and readability. The header files contain function prototypes 
                and macro definitions, 
                streamlining the compilation process.</p>

            </li>

            <li>

              <b>Preprocessor Directives</b>

              <p>I used #ifndef and #endif preprocessor directives to prevent multiple inclusions of 
                the same header file. This technique ensures that each header file is included only once,
                avoiding potential conflicts and redundancy</p>

            </li>

            <li>

              <b>Complex Algorithms</b>

              <p>The project involves implementing various complex algorithms for operations such as:</p>

              <ul>

                <li> <b>Basic Arithematic:</b> <p>Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</p> </li>

                <li> <b>Advanced Functions:</b> <p>Square root, exponentiation and logarithms etc.</p> </li>

                <li> <b>Trigonometry:</b> <p>Sine, cosine and tangent functions.</p> </li>

              </ul>

            </li>

            <li>

              <b>Error Handling</b>

              <p>Robust error handling mechanisms are being integrated to manage exceptional cases like division by zero, 
                invalid input, and overflow/underflow conditions. 
                This improves the reliability and user experience of the calculator.</p>

            </li>

            <li>

              <b>User Interface</b>

              <p>I am developing a simple text-based user interface to interact with the calculator. 
                The interface allows users to input expressions and view results,
                ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>

            </li>

            <li>

              <b>Code Efficiency</b>

              <p>The project emphasizes writing efficient and optimized code. 
                Techniques such as loop unrolling, efficient memory management, 
                and minimizing redundant calculations are being employed to enhance performance.</p>

            </li>

            <li>

              <b>Testing and Debugging</b>

              <p>Comprehensive testing is being conducted to ensure the accuracy and reliability 
                of the calculator. Various test cases are designed to cover all possible scenarios
                , and debugging techniques are applied to identify and fix issues.</p>

            </li>

          </ul>

          <b>Conclusion</b>

          <p>This ongoing project not only strengthens my understanding of fundamental programming 
            concepts but also equips me with practical skills in organizing and optimizing code. 
            By working on this calculator, I am gaining valuable experience in handling 
            real-world programming challenges and improving my problem-solving abilities.</p>

        <h2>Lost Projects</h2>

        <article>

          <p>During my journey in software development, 
            I undertook several challenging projects that greatly contributed 
            to my learning and growth. Despite unfortunately losing these projects
            , they remain a significant part of my experience.</p>

          <ul>

            <li>
              <b>Encryption and Decryption of User Inputs</b>

              <p>One of the key projects involved implementing basic encryption and 
                decryption algorithms to secure user inputs. This project 
                enhanced my understanding of the importance of data security.</p>

            </li>

            <li>

              <b>Storing Data in Files</b>

              <p>Another project focused on efficiently storing and retrieving data from files.
                By creating a robust file handling system, I learned about different file formats, 
                data serialization, and the importance of efficient data management.</p>

            </li>

            <li>

              <b>Logic Building</b>

              <p>Throughout my projects, I invested significant effort into building complex 
                logic to solve various problems. This involved breaking down problems into smaller, 
                manageable tasks and implementing algorithms to optimize performance.</p>

            </li>

          </ul>

          <p>Despite losing these projects, the knowledge and experience I gained from 
            them continue to influence my current work. They served as stepping stones in my journey, helping me build 
            a solid foundation in software development and project management.</p>

          <b>Note: These projects included basic encryption and decryption of user inputs, 
            storing data in files, and logic building, which were valuable learning experiences despite being lost.</b>
