        <h2>My Projects</h2>

        <p>Throughout my programming journey, I have delved into a variety of projects that span the spectrum from
          basic logic building to developing complex algorithms, and creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). My
          work includes handling user input, error management, file operations, and memory management in C,
          showcasing my comprehensive understanding and application of these critical aspects of programming.
          Currently, I am focused on building this portfolio to display my skills and achievements effectively. In
          addition, I am actively working on configuring Neovim using Lua, enhancing my development environment
          and contributing to my continuous learning and growth in the field.

          I am also proficient in using Bash scripting to manage tasks such as creating backups and automating
          routine processes, which has significantly improved my productivity. Moreover, I am continuously
          learning new aspects of assembly language, with plans to undertake a basic project in assembly soon,
          further broadening my programming expertise.</p>

          <h3>Calculator Project (C)</h3>
          <p>In this project, 
            I am developing a comprehensive calculator application in C, 
            focusing on integrating advanced programming concepts and 
            complex algorithms.</p>

          <ul>
            <b>Key Learning Points</b>

            <li>
              <b>Header Files</b>
              <p>I have organized my code using header files (.h). 
                This helps in separating declarations from implementations, 
                improving modularity and readability. The header files contain function prototypes 
                and macro definitions, 
                streamlining the compilation process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Preprocessor Directives</b>
              <p>I used #ifndef and #endif preprocessor directives to prevent multiple inclusions of 
                the same header file. This technique ensures that each header file is included only once,
                avoiding potential conflicts and redundancy</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Complex Algorithms</b>
              <p>The project involves implementing various complex algorithms for operations such as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> <b>Basic Arithematic:</b> <p>Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</p> </li>
                <li> <b>Advanced Functions:</b> <p>Square root, exponentiation and logarithms etc.</p> </li>
                <li> <b>Trigonometry:</b> <p>Sine, cosine and tangent functions.</p> </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Error Handling</b>
              <p>Robust error handling mechanisms are being integrated to manage exceptional cases like division by zero, 
                invalid input, and overflow/underflow conditions. 
                This improves the reliability and user experience of the calculator.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>User Interface</b>
              <p>I am developing a simple text-based user interface to interact with the calculator. 
                The interface allows users to input expressions and view results,
                ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Code Efficiency</b>
              <p>The project emphasizes writing efficient and optimized code. 
                Techniques such as loop unrolling, efficient memory management, 
                and minimizing redundant calculations are being employed to enhance performance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Testing and Debugging</b>
              <p>Comprehensive testing is being conducted to ensure the accuracy and reliability 
                of the calculator. Various test cases are designed to cover all possible scenarios
                , and debugging techniques are applied to identify and fix issues.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <b>Conclusion</b>
          <p>This ongoing project not only strengthens my understanding of fundamental programming 
            concepts but also equips me with practical skills in organizing and optimizing code. 
            By working on this calculator, I am gaining valuable experience in handling 
            real-world programming challenges and improving my problem-solving abilities.</p>
