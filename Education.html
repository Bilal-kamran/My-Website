                <p>I am currently in the 10th standard, 
                    where I am building a solid foundation 
                    in various academic subjects. In addition 
                    to my formal education, I have pursued 
                    additional learning opportunities to 
                    enhance my skills. I have taken freelancing 
                    and graphic designing courses from 
                    DigiSkills.pk, where I gained practical 
                    knowledge and hands-on experience in 
                    these fields. These courses have equipped 
                    me with valuable skills that complement my 
                    academic studies and contribute to my overall 
                    growth and development.</p>
