        <p>I am currently in the 10th standard, 
          where I am building a solid foundation 
          in various academic subjects. In addition 
          to my formal education, I have pursued 
          additional learning opportunities to 
          enhance my skills. I have taken freelancing 
          and graphic designing courses from 
          DigiSkills.pk, where I gained practical 
          knowledge and hands-on experience in 
          these fields. These courses have equipped 
          me with valuable skills that complement my 
          academic studies and contribute to my overall 
          growth and development.</p>
